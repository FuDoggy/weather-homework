# WEATHER HOMEWORK

## CHALLENGES
This assignment was another tough one for me.  While I understood a lot of the logic involved, I didn't feel as though I was ready for all the requirements that I needed to execute (i.e. creating a button every time a city was entered, and have that button be clickable and send the user to that city's temp and forecast, and have it stored to local storage.)  I concentrated heavily on the back-end pieces, as I knew that those were the important concepts.  I hardly styled at all, especially given the fact that I ran out of time.  I think I did a decent job of getting the information from the API and displaying them on the page.

## USAGE

This weather app calls two APIs (Google Maps Geocode & Open Weather) in order to isolate a user-inputted city's current and future forecasted weather, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV Index.  The user inputs any city in the world, and the app will call on the API to return the temperature statistics for that city along with a 5-day forecast.
